# FROST Notebook

This Python Jupyter Notebook provides an educational implementation of the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) cryptographic protocol. FROST is a protocol that enables secure multi-party threshold digital signatures.

Please note that this implementation is **not meant for production use** and is intended solely for educational purposes. It serves as a basic example to help understand the concepts of the FROST protocol and its implementation. Use it at your own risk and discretion.

## About FROST Protocol

FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) is a cryptographic protocol that allows multiple parties to collaboratively sign a message while maintaining security against various types of attacks. It utilizes threshold cryptography, where a signature can be generated only when a threshold number of parties cooperate.

## Notebook Contents

1. **Setup and Dependencies:** Details about the required libraries and tools to run the notebook.

2. **Key Generation:** Step-by-step key generation process for FROST protocol.

3. **Signature Generation:** Explanation and code for generating a collaborative threshold signature.

4. **Signature Verification:** Verifying the validity of the threshold signature.

5. **Sample Usage:** Example usage of the FROST protocol functions.

## Warning

The code provided in this notebook is **not secure for production use**. It lacks various security measures and optimizations necessary for real-world deployment. Do not use this code for actual cryptographic operations or applications.
